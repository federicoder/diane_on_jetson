### Project Structure and Description

The following repository, named **diane_on_jetson**, was created for the masterâ€™s thesis project with the purpose of implementing a lossy codec called **DIANE** on the ROS 2 Humble `point_cloud_transport` plugin.
This repository is part of a master's thesis project aimed at extending the [`point_cloud_transport`](https://github.com/ros-perception/point_cloud_transport_plugins/tree/humble) repository, a standard ROS 2 plugin-based system for publishing and subscribing to compressed `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2` messages.

The goal of this work is to create a pipeline used to perform lossy compression operationn for point clouds with ROS2 HUMBLE. To implement this pipeline, it is used a particoular image of **ROS2 HUMBLE** containing **ZED SDK**, and all requirements needed to use Torch (wheeled version) in a JETSON XAVIER NX.
The  new **lossy point cloud compression plugin** used in `point_cloud_transport` is called `DIANE` and it enables real-time performance using a custom algorithm based on **PyTorch** and its c++ wheeled version **Torch**. This plugin complements existing ones like `zlib`, `zstd`, and `draco`, and is designed to optimize the trade-off between compression ratio, processing time, with a strong focus on runtime efficiency for real-time robotics applications.

In the repository, the main modules are:
- Dockerfile.tegra: dockerfile in which there are all the necessary images and SDK to build a Ros2 Humble enviromnet (pointcloudtransport, ZED SDK, torch, etc..)
- my_build.sh: to build the above dockerfile.
- my_run.sh: to start a container with all the necessary configuration setup.
- src directory: the src directory copied in the container.

### DIANE_POINT_CLOUD_TRANSPORT
It is the main subdirectory of `point_cloud_transport` that implements in c++ language the codec `DIANE`. It can be found in `src/point_cloud_transport_plugins-humble`. It is possible to find the src directory in which there are all implemented codes and the include directory to see the the related headers files.

### zed_pointcloud_publisher
It is the ros2 package used to acquire from the `ZED-CAMERA` and `ZED-SDK` the point cloud. This package is built in python languange and it can be easly used to change all paramterers of the acquisition process.

### dynamic_encoder_pkg
It is the launchdr used to change the operation paramters (bandwidth and FPS) of the DIANE publisher in `point_cloud_transport`. It acquire all the bandwidth and FPS needed by using the commands:
```
ros2 topic bw
ros2 topic hz
```
pointing the Diane Subscriber in which is perfomred the acquisition and conversion of the compressed msgs.

----
## Installation & Usage

This section describes how to set up and run the `DIANE` for `point_cloud_transport` using Docker. The process is divided into three main phases: Docker environment setup, workspace build, and node launching.

### 1. Docker Environment Setup

First, build and run the Docker container that contains all necessary dependencies:

```bash
./my_builder.sh
./my_run.sh
```

### 2. Building the Workspace (inside the container)
Once inside the container (in `/ros2_ws`), build the workspace using:

```bash
colcon build --merge-install --event-handlers console_direct+
```
This command will compile the `point_cloud_transport` plugins and all required ROS 2 packages.

### 3. Launching the Nodes
After everithing is compiled, it is possible to start the zed_pointcloud_publisher and starting to acquire the pointloud giving in input the command:
```
ros2 run zed_pointcloud_publisher zed_pointcloud_publisher
```
Now that the /zed_pointcloud topic is started, it is possible to do two kind of operations to compress the point clouds with `DIANE` in `point_cloud_transport`:
- To start the `standalone` version
- To start the `launcher` version
----
##### Standalone version
For the standalone version, it is given to the user the possibility to change directly the configuration paramters of the publisher compressor node that are : **BANDWIDTH** and **FPS**.
First of all, after having launched the /zed_pointcloud topic, it can be possible to start the compressor node and decompressor node sepratly by giving in input on bash the following commands:
For the compressor node:
```
ros2 run point_cloud_transport republish \
--out_transport diane \
--in_transport raw \
--ros-args \
--log-level DEBUG \
-r __node:=point_cloud_encoder \
--remap in:=/zed/point_cloud \
--remap out/diane:=/pointcloud_diane
```
For the decompressor node:
```
ros2 run point_cloud_transport republish \
--out_transport raw \
--in_transport diane \
--ros-args \
--log-level DEBUG \
-r __node:=point_cloud_decoder \
--remap in/diane:=/pointcloud_diane \
--remap out:=/decoded
```
From now on, all the nodes are uo and it is possible to see in the logs all the msgs acuired by compressor and decompressor nodes.
To see the comfiguration paramters of compressor node is possible to use the commands:
```
ros2 param dump point_cloud_encoder
```
and then to change them is used the commands (for example):
```
ros2 param set /point_cloud_encoder pointcloud_diane.bandwidth 8000000.0
ros2 param set /point_cloud_encoder pointcloud_diane.fps 60.0

```
In this way the bandiwdth of `point_cloud_transport` node that use DIANE codec is changed to 800000.0 bps and the fps to 60.0.
To acquire data, it is possible to create a 'data_csv' folder in the '/ros2_ws' directory, where the 'Diane Subscriber' will save all '.csv' files related to the output of the compression/decompression operations.
It is also possible to change the behaviour of the algorithm using another parameter called lambda (the higher the lambda, the more aggressive the algorithm is).

##### Launcher version
In addition to launching the commands shown in the `standalone` version, run the launcher one with the following command:
```
ros2 run dynamic_encoder_pkg dynamic_encoder_launcher \
  --encoder-node     /point_cloud_encoder \
  --param-bandwidth  pointcloud_diane.bandwidth \
  --param-fps        pointcloud_diane.fps \
  --topic-bw         /decoded \
  --topic-hz         /decoded \
  --period           2.0 \
  --update-interval  10.0 \
  --min-bandwidth    1000000
```
With this configuration the min bandiwidth is set to 1 mbps and the update interval is set to capture the values from `ros2 topic bw` and `ros2 topic hz` within 2.0 seconds (it is not reccomanded to reduce it because it can be too short the time to acquire data).
To change the name of node in which there are the paramters to be changed, it is possible to use the flag: `--encoder-node` and to specify what paramters have to change the flags: `--param-bandwidth` and `--param-fps`.
The flags `--topic-bw` and `--topic-hz` want as input the name of the topic that has to be scanned.
